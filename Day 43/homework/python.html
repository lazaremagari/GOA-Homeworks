            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code<br>
            readability with the use of significant indentation.

            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including<br> 
            structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as<br>
            a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
