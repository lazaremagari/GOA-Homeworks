            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed<br>
            in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies<br>
            such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into <br>
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues <br>
            for its appearance.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as <br>
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured <br>
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, <br>
            and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img <br>
            and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and /p surround and provide <br>
            information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but <br>
            use them to interpret the content of the page.
