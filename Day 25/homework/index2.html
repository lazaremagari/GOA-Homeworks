        Jeep debuted the production 
        version of the Compass at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in 
        January.
         
        The first Compass was assembled on 30 May 2006, in Belvidere, 
        Illinois, where the Dodge Neon was produced.
        The Compass did not carry the "Trail Rated" 
        badge found on other SUVs in the Jeep 
        family for the 2007-2010 model years,
        but received the "Trail Rated" badge 
        for the 2011 model year. The Compass targets first-time Jeep buyers and those who 
        drive
        primarily on paved roads.The Compass 
        and Patriot are both based on the DaimlerChrysler/Mitsubishi GS platform. 
        These vehicles are differentiated by their styling and marketing: The Patriot is a 
        traditionally styled 4-door Jeep wagon, while 
        the Compass has a softer hatchback look, similar to the Dodge Caliber.
