    Four years prior to the introduction
     of the production Jeep Compass, 
     a concept vehicle with the same 
     name had its world premiere in Detroit 
     at the 2002 North American International 
     Auto Show. It featured a two-door body, all-wheel
     drive and a 3.7-liter V6 engine.
     The 3.7 L Power-Tech V6 engine from the Jeep Liberty was not available in the new Compass for 2007, though the production model Compass kept the concept car's styling cues and some of its features. The production model Compass also had four doors instead of the two doors on the concept car.
