    <p>The second generation of the R8 (model code: Type 4S) was unveiled at the 2015 Geneva 
        Motor Show and is based on the Modular Sports System platform shared with the 
        Lamborghini Hurac√°n. The development of the Type 4S commenced in late 2013 and was 
        completed in late 2014 (2015 model year in Europe, 2017 model year in the US). 
        Initial models included the all-electric e-Tron and the V10 5.2 FSI along with the 
        V10 plus. Unlike its predecessor, there was no manual transmission available and the 
        entry-level V8 trim was also dropped.[13][14] In 2016, the convertible (Spyder) 
        variant was added to the line up which was initially available in the base V10 trim. 
        In mid-2017, the high performance V10 plus Spyder was added to the range. 
        A rear-wheel-drive model called the R8 RWS was introduced.</p>
