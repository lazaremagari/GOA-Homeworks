        <li>System virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) 
        provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the 
        functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A 
        hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, 
        allowing for multiple environments that are isolated from one another 
        yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use 
        hardware-assisted virtualization, with virtualization-specific 
        hardware features on the host CPUs providing assistance to hypervisors.</li>
        <li>Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer 
        programs in a platform-independent environment.</li>
