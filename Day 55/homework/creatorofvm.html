    <p>A "virtual machine" was originally defined by Popek and Goldberg as "an 
        efficient, isolated duplicate of a real computer machine. 
        Current use includes virtual machines that have no direct 
        correspondence to any real hardware.[2] The physical, "real-world" 
        hardware running the VM is generally referred to as the 'host', and the 
        virtual machine emulated on that machine is generally referred to as the 
        'guest'. A host can emulate several guests, each of which can emulate 
        different operating systems and hardware platforms.</p>
